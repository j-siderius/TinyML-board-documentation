</div>

### Sensors

The TinyML board contains five different sensors that can be used for gathering data. To see how to use the sensors, look at the [Code Examples](#code-examples).

- **Microphone (I2S)** [_ICS-43434_](assets/datasheets/ics43434.pdf) - This sensor measures the amplitude and pitch of sound.
- **Time-of-Flight range sensor** [_VL53L0X_](assets/datasheets/vl53l0x.pdf) - This sensor measures short-range distance.
- **Environmental sensor** [_BME280_](assets/datasheets/bme280.pdf) - This sensor measures temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure.
- **Hall effect magnet sensor** [_AH49E_](assets/datasheets/ah49e.pdf) - This sensor measures the magnetic field around its axis.
- **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** [_BMI270_](assets/datasheets/bmi270.pdf) - This sensor measures both the angular motion using a gyroscope, as well as the acceleration using an accelerometer.

### Processor

The TinyML board is fitted with an ESP32-S3 SoC. The processor features a fast 240MHz, dual-core processor, large 16MB storage and 8MB RAM. 
Additionally, it has Bluetooth 5 and WiFi capabilities, making it easy to connect the TinyML board to the internet, for example to share sensor data.
More information about the onboard chip can be found in the datasheet: [ESP-S3-WROOM1-N16R8](assets/datasheets/esp32s3wroom1.pdf).

### Input/Output

Besides sensors, the TinyML board also contains multiple Inputs and Outputs (I/O). To see how to use the I/O, look at the [Code Examples](#code-examples).

- **Buttons** - Two buttons are accessible to the user (`Upload/Btn1` and `Btn2`), which can be user-configured. Both buttons need to be pulled high by the processor (see the [Code Examples](#code-examples)).
  The last button (`RESET`) is used if the board needs to be programmed or debugged, e.g. if the TinyML board or the application need to be restarted.
- **Output LED** - The red LED can be used as simple output, e.g. for showing if a sensor functions properly. The output LED is marked `LED` on the TinyML board.
- **Neopixels** - The Neopixel LEDs can be addressed individually to display RGB colors. They can output application information, give users feedback and more. The Neopixels are marked `Neopixels` on the TinyML board.

- **USB-C connector** - This connector is primarily used for programming and serial communication with the TinyML board. It is also the primary power input for the board. To program the board, a USB-C _Data_ cable is needed.
- **Stemma QT / QWIIC** - This connector enables users to connect extra sensors, making the TinyML board suitable for even more advanced projects.
  The connector uses the popular [Adafruit Stemma QT](https://www.adafruit.com/category/620) and [SparkFun QWIIC](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/399) standards, opening up the possibilty for many extra sensors.
  Using a Stemma QT expansion board, users can connect even more sensors in series. For the pinout, refer to the [Expansion headers](#expansion-headers) section. This connector if marked `Stemma QT/QWIIC` on the TinyML board.
- **Expansion header** - This connector can be used to connect extra peripherals, sensors, actuators and more to adapt the TinyML board to different projects. This connector is marked `Expansion Header` on the TinyML board.
  The connector features power, digital and analog connections, as well as support for the SPI high-speed databus. In combination with the ESP32S3's built in GPIO multiplexer, the connector gives the freedom to connect many different things to the TinyML board.
  For the pinout, refer to the [Expansion headers](#expansion-headers) section.

- **Miscellaneous** - The TinyML board also contains some other, miscellaneous component.
  These components are used to show power (green LED, marked `ON` on the TinyML board), convert voltage, debug the TinyML board (header, marked `Debugging` on the TinyML board) and some other passive components. Additionally, the board features some test-points (2x GND, VUSB, 3.3V and IO0) which can be used to verify the functionality of some components.

### Expansion headers

Below a systematic overview of all expansion headers present on the TinyML board is shown. The Expansion header features four analog GPIO pins (A1 - A4 in the top row), four digital GPIO pins (D1 - D4 in the bottom row), as well as 3.3V power and ground (GND). The digital GPIO pins also expose the SPI data bus of the ESP32S3 microcontroller as follows:

| GPIO pin | Description |
| --- | --- |
| D1 / GPIO14 | SPI CS |
| D2 / GPIO11 | SPI MOSI |
| D3 / GPIO12 | SPI SCK |
| D4 / GPIO13 | SPI MISO |

The TinyML board can technically be powered through the Expansion Header, but the power should be stable and noise-free **3.3V** only. If the external power is fluctuating, the microcontroller could be damaged. If it is absolutely nescessary to provide variable external power from another source than USB-C (e.g. from a battery), it is possible to utilise the testpoints GND and VUSB close to the USB-C connector on the board. The VUSB testpoint routes the power through the on-board voltage regulator first, which produces clean 3.3V.

For detailed information about the circuit board, refer to the [Circuit board documentation](/pcb/README.md).

## Software

In order to use the TinyML board, it needs to be correctly setup. The TinyML board requires no hardware setup, but it does require some software setup. In order to start using it, connect a USB-C _Data_ cable to the board and plug it into a free USB port on the system. Below sections detail the setup of the Arduino IDE, installation of sensor libraries and finally the TensorFlow Lite Micro setup.

### Arduino IDE

The TinyML board can be programmed using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), both the new 2.x and Legacy >1.8 versions.
Please make sure that the Arduino IDE is installed on the system before continuing.

In order to program the TinyML board, the [ESP32](#processor) platform need to be installed. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to the `Preferences` (_Windows_: File > Preferences, _Mac_: Arduino > Preferences), as shown in the left image below.
2. In the field `Additional boards manager URLs:` enter the following link (If there are already other URLs in this field,
   open the full list by clicking the folder icon to the right of the URL):
   ```
   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
   ```   
3. Press `Ok` to close the `Preferences`.
4. Open the `Boards Manager` by going to Tools > Boards > Boards Manager.
5. Search for **ESP32** and install the platform by Espressif Systems.
6. Restart the Arduino IDE.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/arduino-preferences.png" alt="Arduino Preferences menu" width="45%">
    <img src="assets/images/arduino-boards-manager.png" alt="Arduino Boards Manager" width="45%">
</div>

For more advanced installations, for example in Platform IO, follow this [advanced installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).

### IDE configuration

In order to use all functions that the ESP32S3 processor has, Arduino IDE must be properly configured when programming the TinyML board. Below are the most important settings, these need to be configured in the `Tools menu` (_Windows_ + _Mac_: Tools) by clicking on the setting and choosing the correct option:

- **Board** - *ESP32S3 Dev Module*: This sets the correct processor and board configuration for the TinyML board. To select the ESP32 Dev Module, first select the *esp* platform.
- **Port** - *port here*: Enter the serial port of the TinyML board here. Refer to the guide [Serial Port](#serial-port-setup) to find this port.
- **USB CDC On Boot** - *Enabled*: This setting enables the onboard USB-C port to be used for serial communication.
- **Flash mode** - *DIO 80MHz*: This setting configures the correct mode for writing to the flash of the ESP32S3.
- **Flash Size** - *16MB (128Mb)*: This setting uses the full storage of the ESP32S3, enabling space for larger projects and more code.
- **PSRAM** - *OPI PSRAM*: This setting enables the fast built-in RAM of the ESP32S3.

</div>

### Serial Port setup

No drivers are required for the TinyML board. However, sometimes, it is nescessary to know on which serial port the TinyML board is connected. To find this out, perform the following steps:

_Arduino IDE_
1. Open the `Port overview menu` (_Windows_ + _Mac_: Tools > Port) and observe which ports are in the list. 
2. Close the list.
3. Plug in the TinyML board and open the `Port overview menu`, observe which port was added to the list > this is the TinyML board port.

If the above method does not work, an OS-specific check can be done using the instructions below:

_Windows_
1. Open `Device Manager` by going to Start and searching for the program. (Alternatively, press the <kbd>![Windows Key](assets/images/winlogo.png)</kbd> key and search for Device Manager)
2. Open the `Ports (COM & LPT)` section.
3. Plug in the TinyML board and observe which COM port was added to this list > this is the TinyML board port.

_Mac_
1. Open the `Terminal` application by going to Applications > Utilities. (Alternatively, press the <kbd>![CMD Key](assets/images/cmdlogo.png) + Spacebar</kbd> keys and search for Terminal)
2. Enter the following command `ls /dev/tty*` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
3. Plug in the TinyML board and repeat step 2, observe which port was added to the list > this is the TinyML board port.

### Arduino libraries

In order to use the sensors on the TinyML board, some Arduino libraries are needed. The recommended libraries are listed below, although other libraries might work as well.

The libraries can be installed into Arduino IDE through the Library Manager (Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries). The versions are included here for documentation purpose, the newest version of each library should work fine.

- [Sparkfun BME280](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BME280_Arduino_Library) (2.0.10)
- [SparkFun BMI270](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BMI270_Arduino_Library) (1.0.3)
- [Pololu VL53L0X](https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino) (1.3.1)
- [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) (3.9.13)

The onboard [Microphone](#sensors) uses the built-in I2S library from Espressif, so there is no library to install to use the microphone. More information can be found in the [I2S Peripherals documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3/api-reference/peripherals/i2s.html). 

### TensorFlow Lite Micro library

Not all normal TensorFlow Ops (layers) are supported by TensorFlow Lite Micro. In order to see what operations the TensorFlow model uses, you can upload your saved model to [Netron](https://netron.app/) and examine it. The supported operations in this version of TensorFlow Lite Micro can be found in the [Arduino-TensorFlowLite-ESP32 README](/arduino-tensorflowlite-esp32/README.md#supported-ops).

A special thanks to [Nikos Kouvaris](https://github.com/nkoub) and [Tanaka Masayuki](https://github.com/tanakamasayuki) for porting the [original Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32 library](https://github.com/nkoub/Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The TensorFlow Lite Micro ESP32 library included in this repository works with the TensorFlow Lite Micro release from Feb 2023.
> With much manual modifications, the library can be updated, however there is no compatibility guarantee as much of the TensorFlow Lite Micro codebase has changed without proper notice and documentation. -->

### Uploading code

To upload a program to the TinyML board, follow the steps below:

1. Connect the TinyML board to the system using a USB-C cable.
2. Ensure that the IDE settings are setup as described in the [Arduino IDE](#arduino-ide) and [IDE configuration](#ide-configuration) sections.
3. Select the correct serial port for the TinyML board, as described in the [Serial Port setup](#serial-port-setup) section.
4. Press and hold the `Upload/Btn1` button, then press the `RESET` button. This puts the ESP32S3 into *Upload*\* mode.
5. Release all buttons and click `Upload`, then wait for the code to upload.

\* Technically, this mode is called *Download*, since the code is downloaded to the microcontroller, but for ambiguities sake, it is called *Upload* here.
