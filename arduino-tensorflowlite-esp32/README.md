# Arduino TensorFlow Lite for ESP32

Pre-zipped Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32 library. Unchanged download from [https://github.com/nkoub/Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32](https://github.com/nkoub/Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The TensorFlow Lite Micro ESP32 library included in this repository works with the TensorFlow Lite Micro release from Feb 2023.
> With much manual modifications, the library can be updated, however there is no compatibility guarantee as much of the TensorFlow Lite Micro codebase has changed without proper notice and documentation.

A special thanks to [Nikos Kouvaris](https://github.com/nkoub) and [Tanaka Masayuki](https://github.com/tanakamasayuki) for porting the [original Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32 library](https://github.com/nkoub/Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32)
